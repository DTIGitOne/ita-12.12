The seventh project : I decided that I wanted to make something unique and fun for this project, so I decided to play around with all of my JavaScript skills and create a small website game in which you can modify what happens to the balls on the screen using JS events.

For this, I used some interesting functions that I had never used before, the main one being MathRandom, where all events are determined by the random number generated. I made it so when clicking on screen the balls would have been created on a random part of the screen as well with a random starting color. Next, I added a clicking event to the balls so that they would generate a random color when clicked. I still felt like I could have added something else interesting to make the game more unique after doing all of this. Therefore, I added a mouseover event that decreases or increases the size of the balls (example:1 decrease, 2 increase) and coded all the other events the same way.

As a result, I thought going into this project it wouldn't be that hard to make since a function like (randomMath) exists. It wasn't the random part of the event that was problematic, but the outcome. What i mean by that is that when i got a number in return i had to put ‘px’ and turn it into a string in order for some parts to be readable(example: size : 30px) and for some i had a random number for a random number, and that created some complicated problem solving for me.

I was happy that i chose to do this because before i made this i haden’t really struggled on a project in this type of way and after finishing it i felt like i now knew a different approach to problem solving of that type.


This took me 3 days to complete.
